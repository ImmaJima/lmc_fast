Faster LMC tester

## How to use interpreter
1. Create a text file, write your code into it
2. Run main.py
3. Enter the name of the text file
4. Optionally enter the name of a text file containing tests if you want to test your program
5. Press enter to run the program
6. Type enter to run the program again once it's done (this is so you can test if you program can be re-run multiple times, without needing to reset memory or whatever). Or type 'exit' to exit the program (or just close it)

## How to generate cases
Just run `gentest.py`, you can also configure the variables to have fewer/more test cases
